    <p>Dear lil bear:</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Sometimes I feel like I walk in a long night but meeting you is one of the most beautiful
      things I have in my life. Your presence and love heal and calm my tired and hurt heart,
      resting in the most soft and delicate ways, those that I sometimes forget exist but with
      your presence, you are there to remind me that and also what many things are aboutâ€¦
      about love and dedication. You're a beautiful and intelligent man, also a bit eccentric
      and calm. That mix of things makes me like you, because it only shows that you are
      special and unique. I admire your way of managing and creating and also your will to
      help others. Every day you help me and that's why I feel thankful to share with you,
      even if it is from far away... because it is better to know you and be far, trying to move
      forward with our love, than not to knowing you and live this moment of my life without
      you by my side.</p>
      
      <p>I know that some part of me has known you for all my life but now I'm in this current
      life getting to remember you little by little.</p>
      
      <p>I love you so much, thank you for making me feel seen.</p>
      <p>Happy birthday my love!!! ðŸ§¸ðŸŽ‚</p>
